# Unit 21: You sure can attract a crowd!

We are going to crowdsale PupperCoin token in order fund the network development.

This network will be used to track the dog breeding activity across the globe in a decentralized way, and allow humans to track the genetic trail of their pets. 

We are only allowed to raise a maximum of 300 Ether. The crowdsale will run for 24 weeks.

We are crearting ERC20 token that will be minted through a Crowdsale contract that you can leverage from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.
